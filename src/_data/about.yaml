    description: Yuki Lyons, a Japanese native, discovered the transformative power of cacao and felt an immediate connection to its healing properties. Venturing to Guatemala, she found herself in a sacred Cacao jungle, immersing herself in Mayan cosmovisi√≥n and cacao facilitation. Yuki's heartfelt cacao ceremonies bridge cultures through prayers in both Japanese and English, connecting with spirits and ancestors. Through channeling visions and expressing gratitude for Mama cacao, she invites you to join her on a transformative journey of self-discovery and healing.
